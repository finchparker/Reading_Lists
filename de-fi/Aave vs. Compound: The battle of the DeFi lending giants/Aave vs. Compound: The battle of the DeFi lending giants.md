## Aave vs. Compound: The battle of the DeFi lending giants

출처 : https://medium.com/coinmonks/aave-vs-compound-the-battle-of-the-defi-lending-giants-edd7c6c7bbc5

Compound (COMP) has been the most popular DeFi lending protocol since its launch in 2018, but according to the latest data trends, Aave (AAVE) has an excellent chance to take its crown.

Back on August 10, 2020, we explained what the burgeoning project is all about. At the time, the Aave share price was still trading under the acronym LEND and reached a market capitalization of $500 million in no time, and even then we wondered if a compound killer had been born with AAVE. Less than half a year later, its market capitalization has increased eightfold to more than 6 billion US dollars.

In terms of performance, the AAVE share price has thus surpassed that of COMP by a long way. This young year, the COMP share price started at about $145, while the AAVE share price was about $88. Currently, both the COMP and AAVE share prices are trading at around $500. This means that the challenger has grown by over 450% since the beginning of January, while COMP has seen a comparatively small (but still impressive) growth of 240%.

The market capitalization metrics tell an even more exact story. Currently, Compound’s market capitalization is $2 billion. Accordingly, AAVE exceeds it by a factor of three.

Of course, it should be noted here that just 43% of all COMP tokens are circulating. For the challenger, it is already 77%. If one were to calculate the fully diluted market cap (= market capitalization if the entire supply of tokens were in circulation at the current price) for both, Compound with $5,000,000,000 would already be closer to Aave with $8,000,000,000. Still, the $3 billion difference speaks volumes here as well.

But is Aave’s winning run over Compound justified? That’s precisely what we’ll examine in this article by contrasting the two lending protocols using significant metrics.

### The TVL assets of Aave and Compound

Total Value Locked (TVL) data, which is the full value of assets deposited on each protocol, supports the disproportionately substantial increase in AAVE’s share price versus COMP. According to DeFi Pulse data, Aave currently has a TVL of $5.5 billion, and Compound has total assets deposited of $3.93 billion. A proud difference of 1.57 billion US dollars.

Compound and Aave were still neck-and-neck on TVL through the end of 2020. Both ended the year just below $2 billion.

It’s worth noting that TVL measures the supply net of assets borrowed. The compound has loans outstanding of about $2.78 billion. On the other hand, the challenger has $481 million in outstanding loans, according to DeFi Pulse data.

### Token design

COMP accounts for $151 million, or 2.2% of Compound’s total supply (= TVL + total outstanding loans).

In comparison, according to the protocol data, about 30% of Aave’s total offering is in their native token ($790M in V1 and $705M in V2). According to the protocol itself, these are exclusively user deposits deposited as collateral for borrowing stable coins. Indeed, the protocol does not allow users to borrow their governance tokens to avoid potential governance attacks where someone could use borrowed AAVE tokens to gain additional voting rights.

These numbers clearly show that the local native token is very actively used as collateral, unlike Compound’s. Accordingly, nearly 25% of AAVE’s current offering is deposited in the protocol itself, compared to only 7.5% for Compound. As a result, there is potentially less selling pressure on AAVE’s price than COMP’s, as the former further tightens the current circulating supply.

The challenger has another captivating advantage over Compound in its token design. This is because 80% of the fees earned are used to buy up and burn AAVE tokens. At Compound, reserves are currently created from the revenues, which are managed by governance.

In doing so, the challenger has collected just under $11 million in fees over the past six months, compared to Compound’s $41.8 million. This suggests that despite impressive metrics at Aave, Compound has seen significantly more activity and generated more revenue from it. However, COMP token holders do not necessarily benefit from this, while AAVE holders indirectly participate in the revenues by burning more tokens and a resulting deflationary effect on the AAVE price.

### The users of Aave and Compound

According to Dune Analytics, the compound still has many more users than Aave in terms of unique wallets.

Of course, this metric should be taken with a grain of salt, as users can theoretically own more than one wallet. Therefore, it is possible that this metric is artificially inflated and cannot be transferred 1 to 1 to the number of actual users. Nonetheless, it provides a useful guide and Compound, with over 300,000 wallet addresses. It is clearly above Aave’s just under 40,000 addresses (Note: Dune Analytics data may only include V1 users. If V2 users were included, the number would possibly increase).

While Aave launched more than a year after Compound in late 2018, both protocols saw the bulk of their user growth in 2020. The challenger started from scratch and saw a relatively steady influx of users that continues to this day. On the other hand, compound started with about 22,000 addresses in January 2020 but then experienced a massive jump from 50,000 addresses to nearly 300,000 from mid-October to the end of December. Since the beginning of 2021, however, Compound’s user growth (about +5,000) has fallen below Aave’s (about +6,000). Accordingly, a reversal of the trend may be evident here.

### The credit volume

Compound also outperforms Aave in terms of loan volume, with a nearly 77% share of the market. Aave’s 23% share is split between its V1 and V2. However, Compound maintained a share of approximately 80% to 90% of loan volume throughout 2020, so its performance in 2021 represents a slight decline. So, again, there may be a change in trend.

Compound has a competitive advantage over the challenger in loan metrics due to its incentive program that rewards both its lenders and borrowers with COMP. This has led to “COMP farming,” where some Compound users borrow and lend at an inflated rate with high-interest rates to maximize their COMP returns.

Aave COO Jordan Lazaro Gustave commented that Compound’s higher loan volume and user numbers are the direct results of their incentivization efforts. He believes that if their protocol were to implement a similar governance reward for liquidity providers, their metrics would trend similarly.

It is safe to say that if we exclude incentivized behavior (leveraged borrowing to Farming COMP & unique inflationary users thanks to an ongoing Coinbase Earn campaign), the Aave protocol outperforms Compound all aspects.

Furthermore, Jordan provided a possible alpha (= valuable information about what’s to come) by adding:

I’m looking forward to seeing how the unprecedented debt numbers develop when and if Liquidity Mining starts on Aave.

### Aave vs. Compound: which is the more innovative protocol?

While both are conceptually quite similar protocols, the challenger proved to be more innovative and faster in implementing additional services. Aave supports over 20 different assets, while Compound supports only 11. The protocol also offers stable interest rates, while Compound does not.

Aave has pioneered developments in DeFi, including flash loans and delegated loan vaults. In December, Compound announced plans to launch Compound Chain, a standalone blockchain that would offer money market functionality across multiple chains. However, the announcement of the exact launch date has so far remained elusive.

Compound’s founder, Robert Leshner, did not comment on specific numbers. He was diplomatic, however, saying:

Compound and Aave are both gaining momentum; 2021 will be a year of phenomenal growth for both protocols.

So far, he has been proven right.

### Conclusion

While Aave Compound is not necessarily going to go out of business anytime soon, the current numbers suggest that Aave could replace Compound as DeFi’s most popular credit protocol in all respects in the future due to its faster growth. The newcomer is already well ahead in many metrics. It also impresses with its more attractive token design for investors.

Nevertheless, the last word has not yet been spoken here. The sales to date suggest that the current valuation is mainly due to the future potential that the market attributes to Aave due to its innovative development. After all, the cash flow itself, compared to other DeFi protocols, is not yet very impressive.
