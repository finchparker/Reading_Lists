A loan that got borrow and repaid in a single Ethereum transaction called flash loan. Hence you don’t need any collateral for flash loans. Here are the properties of a Flash loan:

- Borrow and repaid in a single transaction

- The transaction needs to be completed successfully otherwise everything will be reverted, and you need to pay the only Gas fee (Eth needs to execute the transaction)

### How does a Flash Loan work?

Flash Loans are introduced by the Aave project, which a borrowing and lending protocol built on Ethereum. 

Aave protocol enables typical collateralized loans. Anyone can borrow and lend Ethereum and other tokens using Aave protocol. When you lend your tokens, you earn based on the current interest rate. This is how the protocol gets its liquidity. These are regular collateralized loans and can be borrowed for an extended period.

In the case of Flash loans, anyone can borrow this liquidity, use it with other protocols (Arbitrage, swap, trade, borrow or lend on different protocols, etc.. ), and repay in a single transaction. 

The borrower needs to return the original amount with a small fee; otherwise, the whole transaction will be reverted and will not affect.
