## Aave vs. Compound: The battle of the DeFi lending giants

출처 : https://medium.com/coinmonks/aave-vs-compound-the-battle-of-the-defi-lending-giants-edd7c6c7bbc5

Compound(COMP)는 2018년에 설립된 이래로 가장 유명한 Defi 대출 프로토콜로 자리매김하였다. 하지만 최근에 수집된 데이터를 보면 Aave(AAVE)가 그 왕좌를 쟁취할 가능성이 보여지고 있다. 

지난 2020년 8월 10일, 성장하는 프로젝트에 대해서 설명하였다. At the time, the Aave share price was still trading under the acronym LEND and reached a market capitalization of $500 million in no time, and even then we wondered if a compound killer had been born with AAVE. Less than half a year later, its market capitalization has increased eightfold to more than 6 billion US dollars.

In terms of performance, the AAVE share price has thus surpassed that of COMP by a long way. This young year, the COMP share price started at about $145, while the AAVE share price was about $88. Currently, both the COMP and AAVE share prices are trading at around $500. This means that the challenger has grown by over 450% since the beginning of January, while COMP has seen a comparatively small (but still impressive) growth of 240%.

시가총액을 보면 더 명확해진다. 현재 Compound의 시가 총액은 $2 billion이다. Accordingly, AAVE exceeds it by a factor of three.

Of course, it should be noted here that just 43% of all COMP tokens are circulating. For the challenger, it is already 77%. If one were to calculate the fully diluted market cap (= market capitalization if the entire supply of tokens were in circulation at the current price) for both, Compound with $5,000,000,000 would already be closer to Aave with $8,000,000,000. Still, the $3 billion difference speaks volumes here as well.

But is Aave’s winning run over Compound justified? 그 부분에 대해서는 significant한 metrics들을 기반으로 2개의 대출 프로토콜을 비교하며 이번 글에서 명확하게 설명하고자한다.

### The TVL assets of Aave and Compound

Total Value Locked (TVL) data, which is the full value of assets deposited on each protocol, supports the disproportionately substantial increase in AAVE’s share price versus COMP. According to DeFi Pulse data, Aave currently has a TVL of $5.5 billion, and Compound has total assets deposited of $3.93 billion. A proud difference of 1.57 billion US dollars.

Compound and Aave were still neck-and-neck on TVL through the end of 2020. Both ended the year just below $2 billion.

It’s worth noting that TVL measures the supply net of assets borrowed. The compound has loans outstanding of about $2.78 billion. On the other hand, the challenger has $481 million in outstanding loans, according to DeFi Pulse data.

### Token design

COMP accounts for $151 million, or 2.2% of Compound’s total supply (= TVL + total outstanding loans).

In comparison, according to the protocol data, about 30% of Aave’s total offering is in their native token ($790M in V1 and $705M in V2). According to the protocol itself, these are exclusively user deposits deposited as collateral for borrowing stable coins. Indeed, the protocol does not allow users to borrow their governance tokens to avoid potential governance attacks where someone could use borrowed AAVE tokens to gain additional voting rights.

These numbers clearly show that the local native token is very actively used as collateral, unlike Compound’s. Accordingly, nearly 25% of AAVE’s current offering is deposited in the protocol itself, compared to only 7.5% for Compound. As a result, there is potentially less selling pressure on AAVE’s price than COMP’s, as the former further tightens the current circulating supply.

The challenger has another captivating advantage over Compound in its token design. This is because 80% of the fees earned are used to buy up and burn AAVE tokens. At Compound, reserves are currently created from the revenues, which are managed by governance.

In doing so, the challenger has collected just under $11 million in fees over the past six months, compared to Compound’s $41.8 million. This suggests that despite impressive metrics at Aave, Compound has seen significantly more activity and generated more revenue from it. However, COMP token holders do not necessarily benefit from this, while AAVE holders indirectly participate in the revenues by burning more tokens and a resulting deflationary effect on the AAVE price.

### The users of Aave and Compound

Dune Analytics에 의하면 unique wallet 기준으로 Compound가 여전히 Aave보다는 더 많은 유저들을 보유하고 있다고 한다.

물론 이 metric은 이론적으로 사용자가 1개 이상의 지갑을 가질 수 있기에 조심스럽게 받아들여야한다. Therefore, it is possible that this metric is artificially inflated and cannot be transferred 1 to 1 to the number of actual users. 그럼에도 불구하고 중요한 metric이기는하다. Compound는 300,000개가 넘는 지갑 주소가 있으나 Aave는 40,000개 이하의 주소가 있다. (Note: Dune Analytics data may only include V1 users. If V2 users were included, the number would possibly increase).

While Aave launched more than a year after Compound in late 2018, both protocols saw the bulk of their user growth in 2020. The challenger started from scratch and saw a relatively steady influx of users that continues to this day. On the other hand, compound started with about 22,000 addresses in January 2020 but then experienced a massive jump from 50,000 addresses to nearly 300,000 from mid-October to the end of December. Since the beginning of 2021, however, Compound’s user growth (about +5,000) has fallen below Aave’s (about +6,000). Accordingly, a reversal of the trend may be evident here.

### The credit volume

Compound는 또한 시장의 77%의 점유율을 기록하며 대출 규모에서도 Aave를 능가했다. Aave의 23% 점유율은 V1와 V2로 나뉜다. However, Compound maintained a share of approximately 80% to 90% of loan volume throughout 2020, so its performance in 2021 represents a slight decline. So, again, there may be a change in trend.

Compound는 lender와 borrwer 모두에게 COMP로 보상을 주는 인센티브 프로그램을 갖고 있기에 다른 이들에 비해 경쟁 우위를(competitive  advantage)점하고 있다. This has led to “COMP farming,” where some Compound users borrow and lend at an inflated rate with high-interest rates to maximize their COMP returns.

Aave의 COO Jordan Lazaro Gustave는 Compound가 더 높은 대출 규모(loan volume)와 사용자 수를 낸 것은 보상체계를 좋게 설계하려고 노력한 결과라고 언급하였다. 그는  그들의 프로토콜도 비슷한 거버넌스를 구현한다면 비슷한 결과를 낼 수 있을 것이라고 믿는다.

It is safe to say that if we exclude incentivized behavior (leveraged borrowing to Farming COMP & unique inflationary users thanks to an ongoing Coinbase Earn campaign), the Aave protocol outperforms Compound all aspects.

Furthermore, Jordan provided a possible alpha (= valuable information about what’s to come) by adding:

I’m looking forward to seeing how the unprecedented debt numbers develop when and if Liquidity Mining starts on Aave.

### Aave vs. Compound: which is the more innovative protocol?

2개 모두 개념상으로는 비슷한 프로토콜이지만, 도전자 입장인 Aave가 더 많고 빠른 서비스들을 제공하며 더 혁신적으로 다가서고 있다. Aave는 20개가 넘는 자산들에 대해서 서비스를 제공하고 있으나 Compound는 오직 11개만 제공한다. Aave는 Compound는 제공하지 않는 더 안정적인 이자를 제공한다.

Aave는 DeFi에서 혁신을 이끌어왔다. 대표적으로 flash loan과 delegated loan vault가 있다. In December, Compound announced plans to launch Compound Chain, a standalone blockchain that would offer money market functionality across multiple chains. However, the announcement of the exact launch date has so far remained elusive.

Compound’s founder, Robert Leshner, did not comment on specific numbers. He was diplomatic, however, saying:

Compound와 Aave는 모두 모멘텀을 키워가고 있다; 2021년은 2개의 프로토콜 모두에게 의미있는 한 해가 될 것이다.

So far, he has been proven right.

### Conclusion

While Aave Compound is not necessarily going to go out of business anytime soon, the current numbers suggest that Aave could replace Compound as DeFi’s most popular credit protocol in all respects in the future due to its faster growth. The newcomer is already well ahead in many metrics. It also impresses with its more attractive token design for investors.

Nevertheless, the last word has not yet been spoken here. The sales to date suggest that the current valuation is mainly due to the future potential that the market attributes to Aave due to its innovative development. After all, the cash flow itself, compared to other DeFi protocols, is not yet very impressive.
